                <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">Hey friend! I'm Devanne Aceves - born and raised in Midland. After earning my degree, I gained experience living and working in various Texas cities like Lubbock, Abilene, and Austin before returning to my hometown.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">My coding journey began unexpectedly one summer in 2018. I had an account on this cool artist website that let you customize your page using HTML and CSS. At the time, I had zero clue about coding languages - I just followed guides from other users, copying and pasting lines to add colorful backgrounds, badges, and other fun decorations. Soon enough, I realized I'd accidentally stumbled into the world of coding, and I was eager to learn more!</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">That fall, I started as a cashier at a grocery store in Lubbock. As it turned out, my coworker was the future campus director of <a class="link-primary text-decoration-none" href="https://www.southplainscollege.edu/community/continuinged/codingacademy.php">Lubbock Coding Academy</a> - it was really a right place at the right time sort of moment for me. I jumped at the opportunity and was the first to sign up for this new bootcamp. Even spoke in an <a class="link-primary text-decoration-none" href="https://www.kcbd.com/2019/02/05/lubbock-coding-academy-meets-need-web-developers-area/">interview</a> with KCBD.<br>By fall '19, I was teaching LCA's Early Code afterschool program. Working with the kids at Dunbar Prep was the highlight - so rewarding to impact their lives through coding.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">Besides coding, I'm all about digital art, karaoke, reading (send book recommendations!), cycling (<a class="link-primary text-decoration-none" href="http://strava.app.link/6hbcQXIQ7Ib">follow me on Strava</a>), and being a dog mom to my shih tzu Bubby. I'm big into games, primarily on my Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and really any game my little laptop can handle; and horror movies - especially in theaters!<br>Thanks for reading, feel free to reach me on my socials!</p>
